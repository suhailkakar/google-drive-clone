**Google Drive** is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google. Launched on April 24, 2012, Google Drive allows users to store files in the cloud, synchronize files across devices, and share files
Google Drive gives you the power to upload and save a range of file types — documents, photos, audio, and videos — to Google servers, or the "cloud." Drive can serve as a backup solution, or as a way to free up space on your device.
